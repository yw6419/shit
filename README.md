# Week 2 Exercises

Refer to the exercise instructions at https://object-oriented-python.github.io/2_programs_in_files.html 

These tests are for exercises 2.4 - 2.6. The tests build sequentially so as you push after each question you should see more tests passing. By exercise 2.6, all tests should pass with a correct implementation.
